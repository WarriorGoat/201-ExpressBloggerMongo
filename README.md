# 201-ExpressBlogger

- Create a new file /validation/blog.js:
    - In /validation/blog.js: Create a basic validator function for blogData and add that function to the module.exports
- In /routes/blogs.js:
    - Import (require) the blogData validator function into routes/blogs.js
    - Create one POST route /blogs/create-one to crate a new blog post
        - NOTE: Do not forget to generate createdAt and lastModified keys in the new blog post
    - Create on PUT route /blogs/update-one/:blogTitle to update a blog post
    - Both of the above routes should run validations on the incoming blog post body data BEFORE either creating a new blog post or updating a blog post.  If the blog data is invalid, then a message should be sent in the http response indicating which validation failed and why.
- Build out the blogData validator function to check for the following conditions:
    - Text, title, and author are required fields adn they should be strings
    - Title and author should be no more then 40 characters in length (letters + white spaces)
- Stretch Goal
    - If category is defined and has a length greater than 0
        - There can be no more than 10 entries for a category
        - all entries must be strings
        - all categories must be in the following list of strings:
            - "Lorem"
            - "ipsum"
            - "dolor"
            - "sit"
            - "amet"
